This project is to store an image as a binary file and to retrieve the image from the server and load it into a PictureBox control.  
The program will allow the user to browse for an image file from their computer and store it on a MS SQL Server database. The use
of this code is for use by students.

### Project Introduction
The purpose of this code is to demonstrate the code necessary to take a user provided image file and store it on a server. 
This project will allow for storing images, deleting images, and cycling through available images. 

#### Code Preview:
```csharp
byte[] image = File.ReadAllBytes(openFile.FileName); //Convert image into a byte array
try
{
   cntDatabase.Open();
   string insertQuery = @"INSERT INTO Images(Image) VALUES(@Image)"; // @Image is a parameter we will fill in later
   SqlCommand insertCmd = new SqlCommand(insertQuery, cntDatabase);
   SqlParameter sqlParams = insertCmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("@Image", image); // The parameter will be the image as a byte array
   sqlParams.DbType = System.Data.DbType.Binary; // The type of data we are sending to the server will be a binary file
   insertCmd.ExecuteNonQuery();
   cntDatabase.Close();

   MessageBox.Show("File was successfully added to the database.", "File Added", MessageBoxButtons.OK, MessageBoxIcon.Information);
   ReloadImageList(); // Repopulate the list of images locally

   // We use the MemoryStream to convert our image stored in the list to something the 
   // PictureBox control can understand.
   using (MemoryStream ms = new MemoryStream(lstImages[lstImages.Count - 1].Image))
   {
   Image loadImage = Image.FromStream(ms);
   pbxImage.Image = loadImage;
   }

   intCurrent = lstImages.Count - 1; // Keep track of where we are in our list of images
   }
catch (SqlException ex)
{
   MessageBox.Show(ex.Message, "Error During Upload", MessageBoxButtons.OK, MessageBoxIcon.Error);
}
```
This is not an exhaustive demonstration of storing/retrieving data nor is it a complete solution for any project.
